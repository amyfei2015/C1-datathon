# C1-datathon: 2020 Correlation One Summer Invitational Datathon

**Problem Statement:** Analyze Olympic host city/country data to further our understanding of how 
hosting the Olympics has impacted the respective hosts.

**Datasets:** Weâ€™ve provided several pre-cleaned datasets relating to the Vancouver 2010, London 2012, and
Rio 2016 Olympics, but you are not limited in your analysis to those Olympics specifically.

**Tasks:** You are asked to pose your own question and come up with your own answer using the
available datasets in the available time. What is important is both the creativity of your
question and the quality of your data analysis. You need not be comprehensive; depth of
insight will be rewarded over breadth of the question posed.
Submissions may be predictive, using machine learning and/or time series analysis to
investigate your research topic. Submissions may also be illuminating, through the use of data
visualizations or through sound statistical tests.
- Sample Question 1: Is there a significant difference in the economic results of hosting a summer
vs. a winter Olympics?
- Sample Question 2: Considering factors beyond direct costs and revenues from hosting the
Olympics, can a host reasonably expect to be in a better economic position for having hosted?
- Sample Question 3: Did the Olympics uniformly affect the boroughs in London? Did they
revitalize a specific part of the city?
- Sample Question 4: Brazil simultaneously experienced a health and political crisis during the
Olympics. How were these circumstances reflected in the socioeconomic impact of the Rio
Olympics compared to other games?
